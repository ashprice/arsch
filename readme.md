# Arsch

My Arch Linux installation scripts. At present, it is geared to my desktop environment on a T440P Thinkpad; but I may be adding modularity for different types of development envrionment, hardware, desktop needs, server needs (though I think I will use NixOS for any such needs), etc.

If you'd like me to implement anything, feel free to open an issue.
