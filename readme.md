# Installtion notes

Previously, I had planned to make a modular metadistribution for Arch. Trying to do this taught me a few things:
- Automating an install is not always desirable.
- It is rare that I will not want to change something by hand that is best done early in the setup process. (Ie. I would be writing a script for other, hypothetical people. This is perhaps admirable in conception; but there would be little to distinguish it from the hundreds of other Arch-based install scripts and distributions.)
- While I am not super obsessive about keeping my machine minimal (I have and use several large and superfluous packages; I keep packages around that I do not use often that are the very definition of huge; I have some entire libraries installed for 1-2 programs; I have not yet gotten rid of some programs I wholeheartedly believe to be quite poor software because of a convenience factor; etc.) I *am* quite obsessive about having to make these choices. As such, most of the 'modularity' I would make for myself are only going to be a few commands, that, in general, it is easier to type out than to maintain (because software changes, fex.).
- My singular use-case at the moment is a personal workhorse - I use one machine for everything, and have no remotes. This both removes much inspiration for making a modular setup, and means that I do not setup development environments with regularity.
- NixOS offers an interesting possibility for automating server installs. (Though, there is much that I think is problematic, as well - in many situations I can see myself using Debian or Gentoo or something instead.)
- I actually enjoy installing Arch, as it offers some moments for reflection on my system.
- Etc.
